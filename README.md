This project aims to transform data originally stored in spreadsheets into an integrated system using SQLite as the database and Django as the primary framework for developing a CRM. The application allows importing this data into the SQLite database and visualizing it in various formats, such as tables and Kanban boards, in addition to offering full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities. The system is ideal for managing information related to clients, sales, and tasks, providing an intuitive and responsive interface.

After importing the spreadsheet data into the database, the application organizes and displays the information in a structured way, enabling direct management through browser-based operations. The table interface is suited for detailed queries, while the Kanban format facilitates visual tracking and activity organization. The project is developed using Django, leveraging the framework's robust features for backend management, and employs SQLite, a lightweight and integrated database, for data storage.

The project setup is straightforward and involves steps such as cloning the repository, installing Python dependencies in a virtual environment, running migrations to prepare the database, and importing data from spreadsheets. Once configured, the system can be accessed locally, allowing users to efficiently manage and update their data.

This CRM is a flexible and scalable solution with potential for future enhancements, such as advanced filters, customized search, and additional Kanban features like drag-and-drop functionality. The project is open to contributions, encouraging developers to participate and improve its features.
